          <h3> Student Lightning Talks </h3>
          <p>
            If you are a student doing research on topics related to the conference theme (Tech for Good),
            we encourage you to register to present your work in the format of a lightning talk!
            Each talk is limited to 5 minutes. Students may also present work from their internship experiences and/or projects, 
            as long as it relates to the conference's theme. Students need not feel limited to academic research work, 
            but it is very welcome! We are seeking 8-10 interested students to present their work. 
            If we receive a lot of interest, we may not be able to accomodate all students who express interest. 
            If we are low on student signups, we may cancel this opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please express your interest in presenting a lightning talk through the <a href="https://forms.gle/UhU5ifTyu9hUmcDq6"> Registration Form</a>.
            Student signups for lightning talks will not be accepted after February 1 at 5PM CST. 
            Students will be notified of their presentation status upon the form's closing, before February 3.
            Students should provide any accompanying materials for the talk by February 6 at 5PM CST.
